  A RARE HUMMING BIRD.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">INSTANCES are very rare where
birds are familiar with human
beings, and the humming birds
especially are considered unapproachable,
yet a naturalist tells how
he succeeded in catching one in his
hand. Several cases are on record of
attempts to tame humming birds, but
when placed in a cage they do not
thrive, and soon die. The orange
groves of southern California abound
in these attractive creatures, and several
can often be seen about the flowering
bushes, seeking food or chasing
each other in play. "Once, when living
on the slopes of the Sierra Madre
mountains, where they were very plentiful,
I accomplished the feat of taking
one in my hand," says the naturalist.</p>

<p>"I first noticed it in the garden, resting
on a mustard stalk, and, thinking
to see how near I could approach, I
gradually moved toward it by pretending
to be otherwise engaged, until I
was within five feet of it. The bird
looked at me calmly and I moved
slowly nearer, whistling gently to attract
its attention, as I began to think
something was the matter with it. It
bent its head upon one side, eyed me
sharply, then flew to another stalk a
few feet away, contemplating me as before.
Again I approached, taking care
not to alarm it, and this time I was
almost within reaching distance before
it flew away. The bird seemed to have
a growing confidence in me, and I became
more and more deliberate in my
movements until I finally stood beside
it, the little creature gazing at me with
its head tipped upon one side as if
questioning what I was about. I then
withdrew and approached again, repeating
this several times before I
stretched out my hand to take it, at
which it flew to another bush. But the
next time it allowed me to grasp it, and
I had caught a wild bird open-handed
without even the use of salt!"</p>

<p>One of the curious features of humming
birds is that they are never found
in Europe, being exclusively American,
ranging in this country from the extreme
north to the tropics, adding to
the beauty of field and grove, being
veritable living gems. Nothing can
approach the humming bird in its gorgeousness
of decoration. It is especially
rich in the metallic tints, seemingly
splashed with red, blue, green,
and other bronzes. Some appear to be
decked in a coat of mail, others blazing
in the sunlight with head-dresses and
breast-plates that are dazzling to behold
and defy description. The smallest
of birds, they are one of the most
beautiful of the many ornaments of our
fields and gardens.</p>

<p>In some islands of the south Pacific
birds have been found that had never
seen a man before, and allowed themselves
to be picked up, and even had to
be pushed out of peoples' way, it is
said, yet they must have been very unlike
the birds that are generally known,
or they would have been more timid,
even if they had not learned the fear of
man.</p>

  THE LADY'S SLIPPER.</h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THIS interesting plant belongs
to that remarkable family of
orchids (<i>Orchidaceæ</i>) which includes
over four hundred genera
and five thousand species. They are
especially noted for the great variety
of shapes and colors of their flowers,
many of them resembling beetles and
other insects, monkey, snake, and
lizard heads, as well as helmets and
slippers, the latter giving rise to the
name of the plant in our illustration.
The variety, singular beauty, and delicate
odor, as well as the peculiar arrangement
of the parts of the flower,
make many of the species of great
financial value. This is also enhanced
by the extreme care required in their
cultivation, which must be accomplished
in hothouses, for the majority
of the more valuable forms are native
only in the tropical forests. Many,
too, are rarely found except as single
individuals widely separated.</p>

<p>There are many parasitic species,
and in the tropics a larger number attach
themselves by their long roots to
trees, but do not obtain their nourishment
from them, while those belonging
to temperate regions usually grow
on the ground.</p>

<p>In the last sixty years the cultivation
of orchids has become a passion in Europe
and, to a great extent, in America.</p>

<p>It is said that "Linnæus, in the middle
of the last century, knew but a
dozen exotic orchids." To-day over
three thousand are known to English
and American horticulturists.</p>

<p>Though admired by all, the orchids
are especially interesting to the scientist,
for in their peculiar flowers is found
an unusual arrangement to bring about
cross-fertilization, so necessary to the
best development of plant life. It is
evident also, as shown by Dr. Charles
Darwin, that this was not so in the
earlier life of the family, but has been
a gradual change, through centuries,
by which the species have been better
prepared to survive.</p>

<p>No other family of plants presents as
much evidence of the provision in nature
for the protection of species and
their continuance by propagation.</p>

<p>Few of the orchids are of economic
value to man. The most important
ones, outside of a few used in medicine,
are the vanillas, natives of tropical
America and Africa.</p>

<p>The lady's slipper belongs to the
genus <i>Cypripedium</i> (from two Greek
words meaning <i>Venus</i> and <i>a buskin</i>, that
is, Venus' slipper).</p>

<p>There are about forty species found in
both temperate and tropical countries.
The one used for our illustration is the
"showy lady's slipper" (<i>Cypripedium
reginæ</i> or <i>spectabile</i>) and is a native of
eastern North America from Canada
nearly to the Gulf of Mexico. It
grows to a height of from one to three
feet, and is leafy to the top. It grows
in swamps and wet woods, and in many
localities where it is extensively gathered
for ornamental purposes it is being
rapidly exterminated.</p>

<p>Those living before the era of modern
investigation knew little of the
functions of the various parts of flowers.
We find an excellent illustration
of this ignorance in the following peculiar
account of a South American
lady's slipper, written by Dr. Erasmus
Darwin, father of Dr. Charles Darwin,
in the latter part of the last century.</p>

<p>In his notes on his poem, "The
Economy of Vegetation," he says: "It
has a large globular nectary * * *
of a fleshy color, and an incision or
depression much resembling the body
of the large American spider * * *
attached to divergent slender petals
not unlike the legs of the same spider."
He says that Linnæus claims this
spider catches small birds as well as
insects, and adds: "The similitude of
this flower to this great spider seems
to be a vegetable contrivance to prevent
the humming-bird from plundering
its honey."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WOULDN'T the little readers of
<span class="sc">Birds and All Nature</span> enjoy
a talk with a mother-bird?
The father-bird, it seems to
me, has done all the talking hitherto.
Because he is handsome and can sing
is no reason why Jim, my mate, should
write up the history of his family. It
would have been a sorry attempt had
he tried, I promise you, for though he
is a Hartz Mountain Canary&mdash;pure yellow
and white like the lower bird in
the picture&mdash;he is not at all clever.
My mistress says I have more sense in
one of my little toes than Jim has in
his whole body.</p>

<p>"You cute little thing," she exclaims
when I kiss her, or take a hemp
seed from off her finger, "you are the
dearest and wisest little bird in the
world."</p>

<p>Jim sometimes taunts me because I
wear such sober colors&mdash;black and
brown with green and yellow mixed&mdash;like
the upper bird in the picture&mdash;but
I retort that I am a Hartz Mountain
bird, also, and have just as good German
blood in my veins as he has.
Neither of us ever saw the Hartz
Mountains, of course, for we were born
in Chicago, but our great grandmothers
did, I am sure.</p>

<p>A good husband? No, I can't say
that Jim is. He is too quarrelsome.
My mistress says he is a bully, whatever
that may mean. He has a fashion
of standing by the seed cup and daring
me to come and pick up a seed; the
same with the drinking-water and the
bathing-dish. Then again he is very
gracious, and calls me pet names, and
sings at the top of his voice every love
song he knows. Sometimes I try to
imitate him, when he flies into a rage
and sharply bids me "shut up." I am
too meek to return the compliment,
even when I have grown weary of his
music, but my mistress shakes her finger
at him and calls him a "naughty,
naughty bird."</p>

<p>She can't tame Jim, all she may do.
Few canary birds will resist a hemp
seed when offered on a finger. My
mistress used to crack them between
her teeth and coax and coax him to
take one, but he never would. That's
the reason she calls him stupid, for we
love hemp seed just as you little folks
love peanuts, you know. That's the
way she tamed me, and that's the way
you can tame your canary if you have
one.</p>

<p>I have had a rather eventful history
for a bird. In the first place&mdash;but let
me begin at the beginning and tell you
the circumstance just as it happened.</p>

<p>It was about four years ago, so far
as I can recollect, that I caught my
first glimpse of the world and tasted
the sweets of freedom. One balmy
morning in June, I escaped from my
cage, and the window being open, out
I joyously flew into the bright sunshine.
I was a little dazzled at first and frightened.
How immense the world seemed!
How far away the tender blue sky over
which the fleecy clouds sailed, that sky
which I had thought a mere patch
when seen from my cage in the window!
How many houses there were, and how
inviting the green trees and grass-plots!
I fairly danced with joy, and chirped,
"I'm free, I'm free," as I flew from
place to place, my wings, never tiring,
bearing me from tree to housetop and
from housetop to tree.</p>

<p>Ah, that was a day never to be forgotten.
How I escaped the dangers
which lurk about the steps of the unwary
and innocent has always been a
marvel to me. The hostile sparrows,
for instance, the green-eyed, sharp-clawed
cat, the sling-shot of the cruel
boy, the&mdash;but why linger over horrors
which might, but did not happen?</p>

<p>In this way the morning passed joyfully,
the pangs of hunger, as noon approached,
however, advising me sharply
it was near dinner time. From housetop
to housetop I flew, from tree to
tree, but nowhere could I find a little
china cup filled with rape, hemp, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
canary seed, or a tiny glass vessel filled
with water that I might slake my thirst.</p>

<p>What should I do? A bird brought
up as I had been, I reflected, could
never descend to work for a living, as
the sparrows did, and other wild birds
which I had met among the trees.
Some of them ate insects&mdash;fact, I assure
you&mdash;and one red-headed bird,
wearing a coat of many gay colors, simply
tapped and tapped on a tree with
his hard bill whenever he wanted his
dinner.</p>

<p>"Come in," said the bug, innocently,
who was making his home between the
bark and the tree, "come in."</p>

<p>Nobody appearing, the bug ventured
out to see who his caller might be.</p>

<p>"Good morning," grinned the woodpecker,
and then politely gobbled the
poor bug up.</p>

<p>But I was not brought up that way.
I could not eat bugs, neither could I
rummage in the garbage boxes as the
sparrows did. Oh, how unwise of me,
and how ungrateful to run away from a
home where my every need was faithfully
served by a kind mistress. Like
the prodigal I would return. Surely I
would know the house, the very window
from which I had fled. Yes, I
would start at once, and off I flew in the
direction which I thought I had come.</p>

<p>But, alas! how alike all the houses in
that neighborhood seemed. Vainly
did I fly down on many a window-sill
and peer in. No mistress' face greeted
me, no empty cage swung idly between
the curtains. At length, faint from
hunger and fatigue, I flew down and
perched upon the railing of a porch
where two ladies were sitting.</p>

<p>"You dear little thing," said one of
the ladies&mdash;I want to say here that I
am much smaller than the dark Hartz
Mountain bird who sat for her picture&mdash;"I
never saw a sparrow so tiny, or
marked like you before."</p>

<p>"It's a canary, not a sparrow," said
the other lady, "doubtless, somebody's
lost pet," and she held out her hand,
and chirped and talked to me very
much like my lost mistress had done.</p>

<p>"Poor little wanderer," she at length
said, as I looked at her, but made no
effort to fly away, "I have an idea you
came to us for food," and then she
went into the house and shortly returned
with a cage in the bottom of
which she scattered seed, placing it
upon the ground very close to me.</p>

<p>"Rape, hemp and canary," I chirped,
"the seed I am used to," and down I at
once flew, hopped into the cage, and,
the next moment, was made prisoner.</p>

<p>Sorry?</p>

<p>Well, really I don't know. My period
of freedom had been so brief, and
attended with such anxiety and fear,
that I hardly knew whether to laugh or
cry. The next day, however, I knew
that my lines had indeed fallen in pleasant
places. My first mistress had been
kind, but oh, how much more tender
and thoughtful the new one proved to
be!</p>

<p>"I was a helpless little creature," she
said, "and upon her depended my entire
comfort and happiness." Never
for one day did she neglect me.
Though my regular bill-of-fare was
bird-seed, yet she varied it as she did
her own. Cracker, lettuce, apples,
grapes, cherries, sugar, and always in
the summer, pepper-grass. If you little
folks have a canary never fail, I beseech
you, to give them of the latter
all they want to eat. It costs nothing
and may be gathered in any vacant lot
fresh every day.</p>

<p>What pleasure so kind a mistress
could find in keeping me in a little gilt
cage, I could not see, for there were
screens in the window, and even if there
had not been I don't believe I should
have cared to fly away. Something in
my appearance one day suggested the
thought to her, I am sure, for looking
at me earnestly, she said:</p>

<p>"You are not happy, my birdie, I
fear. Neither would I be, cooped up
in a cage like that," and so she opened
wide the door and out I flew, never to
be a prisoner again&mdash;till, well, I will
not speak of that just here, but keep it
for the close.</p>

<p>What famous times we did have after
that, to be sure. Whenever I felt lonesome
down I'd fly upon the desk where
my mistress sat writing. She would
pretend not to see me till I had hopped
upon the very sheet over which her
pen was gliding.</p>

<p>"Why birdie!" she would then cry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
as though very much astonished, and
off I'd fly, as she made a dash for me,
to the window where I would hide behind
the ruffle of the sash curtain.</p>

<p>"<i>Cheep, cheep</i>," I'd cry, just as you
little folks cry "whoop," when all is
ready, "<i>cheep, cheep</i>."</p>

<p>"Where can my birdie be?" she would
say after awhile, dropping her pen.
"Where can she be?" and then she would
look here and there, till presently approaching
my hiding-place, out I'd fly,
with a gurgle, into an adjoining room,
where I'd again crouch behind the curtain.
Between you and me I believe
she knew all the time where I was hiding
and only pretended to search for
me here and there. Anyway it was
capital fun, and I never tired of it,
though mistress did.</p>

<p>"I can't play with you any more," she
would say, "you quite tire me out," and
then she would go to writing again and
so our game of "hide and seek" would
end for that day.</p>

<p>"Everything needs companionship,"
she said one morning to my master,
"birds, children and men," and so that
day he brought home a large wooden
cage in which was as handsome a canary
bird as you would want to see.
That was Jim, and oh, how happy I
was, when, a few days after, he asked
me to be his mate. I said "yes," almost
before he had got the song out of his
mouth&mdash;I didn't know what a tyrant
and bully he was till afterward, you
know&mdash;and so we went pretty soon to
housekeeping in the wooden cage.</p>

<p>My mistress understood what I wanted
when she saw me picking up threads
and pulling her chenille table cover to
pieces, and so in one corner of the cage
she put a nest made of wire and covered
with a bit of muslin. Near by
were little heaps of cotton-batting,
wrapping-cord, and hair. Dear, dear,
how busy I was for days! Jim, as I
have said before, did nothing much
but sing&mdash;and criticise. More than
once I dragged all the furniture out of
our wire home, because he thought I
should have put the hair in first, and
the cotton and strings in afterward.
For a newly wedded couple, on their
honeymoon so to speak, we did a vast
amount of quarreling. The nest, however,
was at last made cozy enough to
suit us, and so one day I climbed in it
and sat for quite a while. Then I
called to Jim and I must say he seemed
to be just as proud as I was of the
little blue speckled egg which lay
there so snug in the cotton. The next
day but one I laid another, and then
one every day till I had laid five. My,
how I felt when I gathered them up
close under me and sat down to brood.
If all went well, after thirteen or fourteen
days, we would have five dear
birdlings. For fear the eggs might
get chilled I left them only a few
minutes at a time, hurriedly eating a
few seeds, then back on the nest again.
Jim could have helped me very much
by brooding the eggs while I took exercise
and my meals, but he was too
selfish for that. All he did was to fly
about and sing, bidding me to keep
my spirits up. If it hadn't been for
my mistress I should have fared badly,
you may believe. She fed me crackers
soaked in milk, cracked hemp seeds
and placed them around the edge of
the nest, besides other delicacies in
the vegetable line too numerous to
mention. When the birdlings were
born Jim appeared to be very proud
indeed. He couldn't sing long or loud
enough, leaving me to feed the five
gaping, pleading red mouths every
day. Ah, no one knows better than a
mother how much trouble and worry
there is in bringing up a family. I'm
sure I have had experience enough,
for since that time I have had so many
birdlings I can't count them. One
season I had eighteen, three nests, and
six in the nest each time. They were
considered such fine birds that my
mistress had no difficulty in selling
them as soon as they learned to sing.</p>

<p>Now I am coming to a period the
thought of which fills my heart with
sorrow. For some reason that I am
not able to tell you, my mistress concluded
to part with me and Jim. She
shed tears over it, I know, but nevertheless
we felt ourselves being borne
away one night, and in the morning,
lo! we found ourselves in a large, bare
room, on the floor of which was painted
an immense ring or circle. I was sitting
on six blue, speckled eggs at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
time, and didn't mind it so much, but
Jim was very cross and restless, for
the cage door was fastened and he bitterly
resented imprisonment. Alas! from
that time forth we never were to know
freedom again; from that time forth
we had to accustom ourselves to many,
many changes.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock the door of the
room opened and in came a little girl,
followed by a little boy. Then more
little girls and boys, till I counted, as
well as I could, seventeen. All one
family? Oh, no, I'm not talking about
bird families now. As many as could
crowded about the cage and stared at
me with wide-open eyes. The cage
was on a low table so they could peep
into the nest. Oh, how frightened I
was. One little chap thrust his finger
through the bars, and down I flew,
leaving my precious eggs exposed.
That was what they wanted, and oh
how they did exclaim! I went back
pretty soon, however, for I began to
understand that they did not mean to
harm me or the eggs either. However,
it was many days ere I got over
the feeling of fright when stared at by
so many eyes, but by the time the
birdlings were hatched out I had grown
quite used to it. Indeed I felt somewhat
proud of the interest those wee
tots took in my babies, my manner
of feeding them never failing to call
forth cries of wonder and praise.</p>

<p>"She just chews up the seeds and
swallows 'em," said a little chap one
day, "then when the baby birds cry for
something to eat she brings it up and
stuffs it down their long throats with
her bill. My! it's ever so much better
than a spoon."</p>

<p>The teacher laughed and patted the
little fellow on the head.</p>

<p>"That is your first lesson in nature-study,
Victor," said she, and then a
lady at the piano struck up a march
and off they all trooped two by two.</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose we are?"
crossly said Jim, hopping excitedly
from one perch to another, "it looks
like a lunatic asylum to me."</p>

<p>Jim, as I have stated before, is a very
stupid bird. The words "lesson" and
"nature-study" held no meaning for
him.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," I said, watching
the little tots marching with an observing
eye, "that we are in a kindergarten."</p>

<p>"A kindergarten," echoed Jim,
"what's that?"</p>

<p>"Why," I explained, "a school where
young children are taught to love
everything and everybody. Surely we
have nothing to fear."</p>

<p>And so it turned out to be, a kindergarten,
in which, I am proud to say, for
purposes of nature-study, I have raised
many and many a brood.</p>

  WHY AND WHEREFORE OF THE COLORS OF BIRDS' EGGS.</h2>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE why and wherefore of the
colors of birds' eggs, says Ernest
Ingersoll, has been a favorite
theme for speculation,
from the quaint surmisings of Sir
Thomas Browne to the solemn guess-work
of Shufeldt, in his ten "biological
laws explanatory of the variation in
color of the shells of the eggs in class
Aves."* Hewitson piously concludes
that the beauty of these elegant and
often exquisitely attractive objects is
intended for the delight of human
eyes; hence, as he says, eggs simply
white are put out of sight in holes! He
also sees in the larger number of eggs
laid by game-birds a provision by a
benevolent Providence for the joy of
the sportsman and the delectation of
the epicure. Next comes a man who
assures us that the colors of eggs are
due to the influence of their respective
surroundings on the imagination of the
hen birds&mdash;the old story of Jacob's
little trick on Laban in the matter of
young cattle. This school instances as
an example the red blotches prevalent
on the eggs of falcons, regarded by it
as a record of the bloody experiences
of the parents; but it does not explain
why the equally rapacious owls produce
pure white eggs, or the blood-thirsty
skuas and shrikes lay greenish
ones. Other equally fallacious theorizings
might be noted.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE highly esteemed drink referred
to in the above lines is
made from the leaves and very
young terminal branches of a
shrub known as <i>Camellia Thea</i>. The
shrub is spreading, usually two or three
meters high, though it may attain a
height of nine or ten meters. It has
smooth, dark-green, alternate, irregularly
serrate-dentate, lanceolate to obovate,
blunt-pointed, simple leaves. The
young leaves and branches are woolly
owing to the presence of numerous
hair-cells. The flowers are perfect,
solitary or in twos and threes in the
axils of the leaves. They are white
and rather showy. Some authors state
that they are fragrant, while others
state that they are practically odorless.
Stamens are numerous. The ovary is
three-celled, with one seed in each cell,
which is about the size of a cherry
seed.</p>

<p>The tea-plant is no doubt a native of
India, upper Assam, from whence it
was early introduced into China, where
it is now cultivated on an immense
scale. It is, however, also extensively
cultivated in various parts of India, in
Japan, Java, Australia, Sicily, Corea,
and other tropical and subtropical
countries and islands. It is also cultivated
to some extent in the southern
United States, as in Carolina, Georgia,
Mississippi, and California, but apparently
without any great success. The
plant is extensively grown in green-houses
and conservatories on account
of its beauty.</p>

<p>According to a Japanese myth the
tea plant originated as follows: A very
pious follower of Buddha, Darma,
vowed that he would pray without
ceasing. He had prayed for some
years when finally the Evil One over-powered
him and he fell asleep. When
he awoke he felt so chagrined and humiliated
that he cut off both his eyelids
and threw them from him. From
the spot where they fell grew two
plants endowed with the property of
dispelling sleep. Chinese writers maintain
that priests of Buddha introduced
the plant from India. Some authorities
are inclined to believe that the
plant is a native of China; others, that
it was brought from Corea to China
about the ninth century.</p>

<p>Tea-drinking was supposed to have
been discovered by a servant of Emperor
Buttei, 150 B. C., but concerning
this there is much uncertainty. It
is said to have been in use in Japan as
early as 729 of our era. The first
definite information about tea-consumption
in China dates from the year
1550, when a Persian merchant brought
tea from that country to Venice. At a
little later period we find tea mentioned
in various letters and documents of
travelers and merchants, yet it is evident
that it was a costly and rare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
article as late as 1660. In 1664 the
East India Company presented the
queen of England with two pounds of
tea. In fact, it was not until the beginning
of the eighteenth century and
later that tea began to be used in different
parts of Europe. During the
latter part of the seventeenth century
and the beginning of the eighteenth
century tea-houses were established in
various cities of Europe, especially in
England. At the present time tea-houses,
like coffee-houses, have become
practically extinct in civilized countries,
but that does not imply that tea-drinking
and coffee-drinking are on the
wane. Among the English and Slavs
tea-parties are all the rage. The favorite
Gesellschaft <i>Kaffee</i>, coffee-party,
of German housewives indicates that
they give coffee the preference. The
biggest tea-party on record was doubtless
the so-called Boston Tea Party, at
which tea valued at £18,000 sterling
was destroyed.</p>

<p>In spite of the tropical origin of the
plant the largest quantities of tea are
consumed in northern countries, notably
in Russia and Asiatic Russia. Large
quantities are consumed in England
and the United States.</p>

<p>Most authorities are agreed that the
different kinds of tea on the market
are derived from the same species of
plant. Some admit a variety <i>C. Thea
var. viridis</i>. The following are the
principal teas of the market and the
manner of their preparation:</p>

<p>1. <i>Green Tea.</i> After collecting the
leaves are allowed to lie for about two
hours in warmed pans and stirred and
then rolled upon small bamboo tables,
whereupon they are further dried upon
hurdles and again in heated pans for
about one hour, accompanied by stirring.
The leaves now assume a bluish-green
color, which is frequently enhanced
by adding Prussian blue or
indigo. Of these green teas the most
important are Gunpowder, Twankay,
Hyson, Young Hyson, Hyson skin,
Songla, Soulang, and Imperial.</p>

<p>2. <i>Black Tea.</i> The leaves are allowed
to lie in heaps for a day, when they are
thoroughly shaken and mixed. After
another period of rest, two to three
days, they are dried and rolled much
as green tea. In the storing process
the leaves undergo a fermentation which
develops the aroma and the dark
color. The following are the principal
varieties: Campoe, Congou, Linki-sam,
Padre Souchon (caravan tea), Pecoe,
Souchong, and Bohe.</p>

<p>In some countries the teas are scented
with jasmine flowers or orange flowers.
This is, however, no longer extensively
practiced. The essentially Chinese
custom of coloring teas with Prussian
blue, gypsum, and indigo is dying out,
at least so far as the export trade is
concerned, because intelligent civilized
consumers are beginning to prefer
the uncolored teas. Competent authorities
maintain that there is not enough
of the coloring substances added to be
harmful. The workmen preparing the
better qualities of tea are not permitted
to eat fish, as the very enduring
and penetrating fish-flavor would be
transmitted to the tea in the thorough
handling. It seems, however, that a
more or less distinct fishy flavor is perceptible
in many teas, even the better
qualities.</p>

<p>Tea-dust consists of remnants from
tea-chests, dust from the working tables
upon which the leaves are rolled&mdash;in
fact, tea-refuse of all kinds. It is certainly
not a desirable article. Besides
true tea there are leaves and other
parts of a great variety of plants which
have been used as tea. To enumerate
and describe these would be impracticable
in this paper. The following
are a few of the more important: Paraguay
tea, or maté, is highly esteemed
in South America. The Coreans prepare
tea from ginger. The poor Siberians
use cabbage leaves. Teas are made
from the leaves of a great variety of
herbs which are supposed to have medicinal
or stimulating properties similar
to those of tea. Peppermint tea and
chamomile tea are greatly esteemed in
certain localities.</p>

<p>Concerning the adulteration of tea
there seems to be considerable difference
of opinion, some authorities
maintaining that adulteration is common,
while others maintain that it is
very rare, indeed. There is, however,
little doubt that used tea is frequently
redried, rerolled, and resold as good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
tea. Willow leaves, strawberry leaves,
and mulberry leaves are said to be
added occasionally.</p>

<p>Every housewife knows that <i>good</i> tea
is expensive. Since the different teas
are all from the same species of plant
why should there be such a difference
in price? The expensive teas consist
of the very young leaves and terminal
branches and are carefully dried and
prepared under special supervision.
The young leaves and branches have
a more delicate flavor. To determine
whether a sample of tea consists of
young leaves or not soak it in water,
carefully roll out the leaves, and measure
them. If the majority of leaves
measure an inch or more in length it
is a poor quality. It must be remembered
that even fair medium qualities
are mixed; that is, they consist of mature
and immature leaves. The best
and most expensive teas are often sold
at one hundred dollars per pound.
They are never exported, but consumed
by high Chinese officials. Imperial
tea is prepared under the direct supervision
of royal government officials.</p>

<p>Tea owes its stimulating properties
to an active constituent known as thein,
which is in all respects similar to
caffein, the active constituent of coffee.
The flavor which is developed by the
drying process is due to several constituents.
Besides these substances
tea also contains considerable tannin.
Tea consumed in moderate quantities
is beneficial rather than otherwise. Its
injurious properties are due to the
tannin, which affects digestion. If consumed
in large quantities for a long
time the thein causes nervousness and
the tannin causes various dyspeptic
conditions. In China some chew the
leaves treated with arsenic to improve
the complexion. The whitening of the
complexion is, however, due to the
arsenic and not the tea.</p>

<p>Tea is prepared in different ways in
different countries, nevertheless the
preparation of a good cup of tea is
comparatively simple, leaving out of
consideration the many paraphernalia
used by different nations and which
really have no effect except that upon
the imagination. The following is
Emperor Kien Lung's (1680) recipe
for making tea, and which is frequently
found upon Chinese tea cups: "Over a
moderate fire place a vessel with three
feet, showing by its color and form that
it has been much used; fill with clear
water of melted snow and heat it until
the water will turn a fish white or a
lobster red. Pour this water into a cup
containing the leaves of a select variety
of tea; allow it to stand until the
first rising vapors, which form a dense
cloud, become gradually less and float
over the surface as a faint mist. Drink
this precious liquid slowly and thou
wilt find it a powerful dissipator of the
five sorrows which disturb our minds.
The sweet and peaceful rest which we
owe to this drink we may taste and
feel, but may not describe." This
recipe, although two hundred years
old, has not been improved upon.
Stated in a little simpler form the recipe
would read: In a cup with good tea
leaves pour clean boiling water and
allow to stand five or six minutes; decant
and drink slowly.</p>

<p>Tea leaves should never be infused
for a long time for several reasons.
The flavor dissipates and the objectionable
tannin is more and more extracted,
imparting to the tea astringency and a
bitterness, which are not only disagreeable
to the taste but also cause indigestion
and constipation. After the
tea is prepared as indicated it may be
taken hot or cold, with or without
sugar, with or without cream or milk.
Iced tea, with a little lemon juice
added, is a delicious drink for hot
weather. It is cooling besides having
a tendency to check excessive perspiration.
Tea has also been found valuable
as a wash for inflammation of the
eyes.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I wish to refer the
reader to an article in the July number
of the <i>Cosmopolitan</i> on "Tea-drinking
in many lands," by Laura B. Starr, in
which are related many interesting customs
relative to the use and preparation
of tea.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE home of my childhood and
early youth nestles in one of the
gems of woodland which are so
characteristic of the rolling
prairies of central Iowa. This hundred-acre
grove covers five main hills, with
their valleys and the lesser runs which
divide each of the five hills into two,
three, or four lesser hills. The hills
radiate in a semicircle to the north and
west from the height on which the old
home stands, rolling away to the creek
which bathes their feet. Here are
tall, heavy woods, without underbrush,
covering the north slopes; lower, more
open woods with patches of plum, and
wild crab apple trees, with some hazel
brush on all lower slopes of the hills;
and finally a liberal fringe of low,
brushy trees&mdash;hawthorn, plum and crab
apple trees&mdash;and dense hazel brush on
the uplands and on lower lands away
from the creek. This dense growth also
fringes the county road which extends
from end to end of the grove, and it
was from this roadside that towhee
first heralded his arrival from the south,
during the bright days of late March
or early April. Later, when the frost
had left the ground, and his mate was
growing anxious to be selecting a nesting-place,
he might be seen on the
topmost twig of one of the taller small
trees in every brushy place on every
hillside. I have sometimes wondered
if the towhee household did not have
some disagreement about the family
name, for the male, from his elevated
perch loudly calls <i>towhee-e-e-e</i>, while
his spouse on the ground below no less
vigorously reiterates <i>che-wink</i>. But
if danger seems to threaten his lordship
quickly descends to join his mate
in earnest warning that this small bit
of earth belongs by right of discovery
to che-wink. How earnestly both
birds emphasize their claim by the
nervous fluff of the short, stiff wings
and the quick spreading of the long
tail, as if the large patches of white at
its end would startle the intruder away.
But the male bird does not always
confine himself to the iteration of the
name he seems to love so well. Instead
of the single first syllable there
may be two or even three, no two in
the same pitch. It has been a surprise
to me that persons unfamiliar with the
towhee's song do not realize that the
two parts proceed from the same bird.
To them the first part seems to resemble
some part of the wood thrush's
song and the last part&mdash;the <i>he-e-e-e</i>&mdash;the
rattle of downy woodpecker. My
ear persistently renders the whole
song, <i>towhee-e-e-e</i>, or <i>towhe-hee-e-e-e-e</i>,
or <i>O towhe-he-e-e-e-e-e</i>. Others render
it <i>chuck burr pilla-will-a-will</i>. But
towhee is not limited to this variety of
vocalization. Besides the abbreviation
of his <i>che-wink</i> alarm note to
<i>swink</i>, or even <i>wink</i>, and a <i>chuck,
chuck</i>, when the nest is threatened, he
sometimes sings a rarely beautiful
ditty which is totally unlike any of his
other performances. I have heard it
only shortly after his arrival from the
south, before his mate had joined him,
and have tried in vain to describe it.
The bird moves slowly and sedately
about among the fallen leaves in a
soliloquy over the happenings of the
long journey just ended, with apparently
no thought of the absent mate.
The manner of its utterance indicates
that this is the bird's private song,
egotistic if you please, while his tree-top
rendition is evidently his altruistic
performance.</p>

<p>The ordinary song and call and
alarm notes are well rendered in the
local names bestowed upon the bird:
Towhee, che-wink, joreet, joree, charee,
pink-pink, and wink-wink. His chestnut-colored
sides and lowly habits
have given him the names of ground
robin and swamp robin, and his red
iris, red-eyed towhee.</p>

<p>Nesting begins about the first of
May in northern Ohio. The nest is
almost always placed on the ground,
often in a slight depression made by
the birds, rarely in a bush up to seven
feet from the ground. It is made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
material easily accessible in the region
of the nest, of dry leaves for a foundation
upon which plant stems, dry grass,
grape-vine bark, or like material is arranged,
and the whole lined with fine
rootlets. The material will vary somewhat
with locality and situation of the
nest, as a matter of course. Rarely
the nest may be covered, with the entrance
in the side, but it is usually not
covered. The nest site is preferably
some distance from a road or foot-path,
often in moderately deep woods
where there is little underbrush, but
more often in the shrubbery fringing
the woods, either on a hill-top or side
hill or bottom land. Here at Oberlin,
Ohio, I have found more nests in the
low second growth near swampy places
than elsewhere.</p>

<p>The nest complement is from three
to five eggs, usually four. The egg
seems to be a rather rounded ovate,
running to nearly spherical on the one
hand to elongate oval on the other.
The ground color is white, not seldom
tinged with pink or blue, with sprinkling
of reddish-brown dots, spots, and
blotches. It is a common experience
to find eggs of the parasitic cowbird
in nests of towhee. Twice I have
found nests on which the mother towhee
was serenely sitting with four eggs
of the cowbird beneath her and none
of her own. Two eggs of the cowbird
and two or three of the towhee in a
nest are common. Sometimes the
parasitic eggs so closely resemble
those of the parent that it is not easy
to distinguish between them, but often
the difference is very marked.</p>

<p>The towhee is a fairly common inhabitant
of the whole region east of
the Rocky Mountains and north to the
northern border of the United States,
breeding everywhere north of northern
Alabama.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE past summer I saw the most
charming baby-bird of my life.
He was so tiny and silvery, his
upper feathers such a lovely
olive-green and the under plumage such
soft white, and over the bright, innocent
little eyes a beautiful curving line like
an eyebrow. I did not at first recognize
him, but the next day I saw two,
probably of the same flock, hunting
very industriously over an old tree, and
I knew they were the young red eyed
vireos. Their feathers were all new and
fresh, and that made them look so silvery
and the tints seem so clear.</p>

<p>The same summer I became very well
acquainted with a different set of bird-babies.
They were still younger, for
their feathers had a soft, downy look,
and fluffed out so that they really
looked larger than their tiny parents.
They were silver gray, the little blue-gray
gnat-catchers, and nothing could
be more charming than the way they
twinkled about the bushes, or turned
somersaults in the air to catch flying
insects on the wing. Their little songs,
as low as whispers, their call-notes "like
a banjo-string" <i>ting!</i> and even their low
scoldings, were very pretty, and seemed
to belong to them perfectly. Someone,
who did not know birds very well
called them little wrens, and they really
had a good many of the restless movements
and alert attitudes of these birds,
but their habits are totally different.
For instance, their life begins in a lichened
cup high up among the top boughs
and it is only in the late summer, when
birds break their rules and go as they
please for a brief holiday time before
the migration, that you will see the
gnat-catchers come down to the low
bushes. I can hardly believe it myself,
but I once saw a young one picking
away on the ground.</p>

<p>One charm about the tiny birds,
gnat-catchers, chebecks, vireos, kinglets,
and the like, is that they are not usually
so shy as large, handsome birds, and I
have often had them almost within
touch, singing, feeding, preening their
feathers, in the loveliest and most confiding
way.</p>

<h2><a name="WISH-TON-WISH" id="WISH-TON-WISH"></a>
  WISH-TON-WISH.</h2>

<p class="ac">EMMA M. GREENLEAF.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_o.jpg" width="57" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">ONE bright May morning Wish-ton-wish
sat on the mound in
front of his family burrow.
Wish-ton-wish was a lively
young prairie-dog and he wanted to
talk with someone.</p>

<p>Presently Madam Talky came out of
her burrow and ran up to the top of her
mound.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," called out Wish-ton-wish;
but Madam Talky did not
even turn her head his way. I dare say
she thought to herself, "Humph! A
chit of a fellow like that isn't worth my
time."</p>

<p>Now Wish-ton-wish was an only boy
in a family where there were five other
children, so that he had come to believe,
as only sons often do, that he was
wise enough to talk with a very Solomon
of prairie-dogs. The silence of Madam
Talky didn't hurt his feelings in the
least. Presently he called out again
and this time with greater tact: "How
are your charming daughters this morning?"</p>

<p>O, you should have seen the change
in Mrs. Talky. She turned her whole
face toward Wish-ton-wish now and
fairly beamed upon him.</p>

<p>"Very well, indeed, thank you," she
answered; "you must call to see us."</p>

<p>And this time I dare say she thought
to herself, "Why, I can hardly realize
that the young fellow is about grown
up; how fine he looks, too; his family
must have great confidence in him to
let him be sentinel when he is so young."</p>

<p>Wish-ton-wish thanked her politely
for the invitation, and said that perhaps
he might call that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Have you heard that Mr. Grizzle
Prairie Dog has been found?" asked
Madam Talky.</p>

<p>"No, where?" said Wish-ton-wish.</p>

<p>"O, in a very strange place," madam
answered.</p>

<p>"It was Mr. Talky that found him.
At least we feel pretty sure that he did.
It was this way: Mr. Talky often has
attacks of dyspepsia, and last night he
ate so much timothy hay for his supper
that he had to run back and forth in
our burrows for exercise, ever so long
before he went to bed. He put his
head out at the end of the longest burrow
to see if the moon was full and
there stood two boys with a gun and a
dead hawk. He heard them say they
wanted the hawk for a 'collection.'
Then one of them said, 'Wish we could
have shot it before it caught that prairie-dog.'
Mr. Talky was so dreadfully
startled that he whirled round and fairly
flew back through the burrow to his
nest, but we feel sure it was Mr. Grizzle
that the hawk had caught."</p>

<p>"How many enemies our race has!"
said Wish-ton-wish with a sigh. "Have
you told Mrs. Grizzle the sad news?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I told her before sunrise this
morning; but she's got used to it now
and doesn't feel so bad. He had been
missing two days, you know. I saw
her going after clover with Mr. Reddy
Prairie Dog. You remember Mrs.
Reddy was eaten up by a coyote last
week."</p>

<p>"Dear me, dear me," sighed Wish-ton-wish
again, "how many enemies our
race has!"</p>

<p>Just then there came a warning yelp
from a sentinel some distance away.
Madam Talky and Wish-ton-wish and
every other prairie-dog in sight echoed
the yelp and then each one of them
leaped into his burrow like a flash.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
They must have turned a double-quick
somersault, for, like another flash there
were the little heads and bright eyes
looking out at the very openings where
their tails had vanished an instant before.
Scores of curious little faces
were peering out and their owners were
anxious to know what made the first
prairie-dog call out, "Danger, danger!"</p>

<p>Again came several quick calls from
the distant sentinel; then all the little
animals disappeared into their burrows.</p>

<p>No, not quite all of them. Way over
on Last street there was an exciting
scene. Mr. Silence Prairie Dog sat upright
in front of his door fairly shaking
all over with anger. His body shook,
his tail shook, his head shook, and he
yelped and barked&mdash;turned and popped
into his burrow&mdash;turned again and
popped out of his burrow in the same
instant, and acted like one going crazy.</p>

<p>No wonder! Crawling slowly along
through the short, dry grass, came a
large rattlesnake. Nearer and nearer
it glided to the door of the burrow.
When it was almost there, Mr. Silence
Prairie Dog keeled into his house, the
snake slid after him, and then silence
fell.</p>

<p>That night the village heard the rest
of the story&mdash;how Mr. and Mrs. Silence
Prairie Dog bit at the rattlesnake with
their sharp teeth and scratched at him
with their sharp claws, but could not
drive him out of their nest where lay
two baby prairie dogs. These two he
ate for his dinner and then lay down in
the deep, soft, warm nest of dried grass.
How Mother Silence crept back after
a long time and found the greedy old
snake lying dead. Yes, truly; killed
by the fierce bites of Mr. and Mrs.
Silence.</p>

<p>Now all these sad affairs made young
Wish-ton-wish quite blue.</p>

<p>Besides, when he went that afternoon
to call on the Talky misses, he found
that the plumpest one had gone after
timothy with another young fellow.
All at once he made up his mind that
life was a failure and that he would run
away from home.</p>

<p>When the prairie-dog folk found out
that he was gone they were very sorry.
They felt sure he had been eaten by
some bird of prey or by a sly coyote.</p>

<p>"He was so wise and so handsome
and so brave," said his mother; "there
was no young fellow in the village who
could be named in the same day with
Wish-ton-wish."</p>

<p>Most everybody praised him now
that he was dead, or now that they
thought he was. I wonder if it isn't
rather a poor plan to wait until people
are dead or far away before we say the
kind things that might have made them
happy when they were near?</p>

<p>"We must not neglect our duties
even in sorrow," said the father. "It
is going to rain. Let us go out and
put our mound into good order so that
the water may not run into our burrows."
They worked with a will, and
found out, as everyone always does,
that nothing helps sorrow and trouble
so quickly as hard work.</p>

<p>When morning came the very first
one to be out of a burrow was Wish-ton-wish's
mother. Perhaps she had
not slept any all night.</p>

<p>She went up to the top of the mound,
then stood still with astonishment and
joy; for there, on the other side of it,
was Wish-ton-wish, hard at work. He
was patting and smoothing the sides
and making them even after the rain.</p>

<p>"O, where have you been all night,
Wish-ton-wish?" cried his mother.</p>

<p>"I went over to the next village; I
thought they might not have so many
troubles as we have and perhaps I'd
stay. But they have even more,
mother; they have snakes and hawks
and owls and coyotes and <i>men</i>, for yesterday
some <i>men</i> came there with a
great tank of water and poured five
barrels into one burrow. They said
they were making an 'experiment.' Of
course they couldn't drown anybody
because the burrows run down and up
in every direction. So I thought I'd
come home again."</p>

<p>"My son," said his mother, "you
have learned a wise lesson. It is of no
use to run away from trouble, hoping
to find a place where there isn't any.
Trouble comes everywhere; and so
does happiness."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; I believe it," said
Wish-ton-wish, and he looked with soft
eyes over toward the burrow of the
plumpest Miss Talky.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BEE_AND_THE_FLOWER" id="THE_BEE_AND_THE_FLOWER"></a>
  THE BEE AND THE FLOWER.</h2>

<p class="ac">MRS. G. T. DRENNAN.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_v.jpg" width="57" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">VIRGIL, in his "Pastorals," beautifully
alludes to the industry
of the bee in culling its sweets
from the flower. Perhaps we
do not definitely know more of the
mystery of the flower's secreting the
nectar, and of the bee's making the
honey, than was known in ancient times.
There are differences of opinion on the
subject. Darwin considers the honey secreted
by the nectary to be the natural
food with which the stamens and pistils
are nourished. Others assert that
the only use of honey with which flowers
are supplied is to tempt insects,
which, in procuring it, scatter the dust
of the anthers and fertilize the flowers,
and even carry the pollen from barren
to fertile flowers. Linnæus considered
the nectary a separate organ from the
corolla; and every part of the flower
which was neither stamen, pistil, calyx,
nor corolla, he called a nectary; but
what he called nectaries are at present
regarded as modifications of some part
of the flower; in some cases a prolongation
of the petals, and in others an
inner row of petals, or modified stamens
adhering to the corolla. The
term disk is now applied to whatever
appendages appear between the stamen
and pistil, formerly called nectaries.
The form of the honey sac, or
nectary, differs with different flowers.
In the lily it is a mere cavity, or gland.
In the honeysuckle a golden fluid is secreted
at the end of the tube, without
the sac. Few things in nature can be
more beautiful than the nectary and
the honey drops in the crown imperial.
Each one is a shallow cup and pearly
white. From each cup hangs a shining
drop, like a tear. The tint of the cup
gives the drop its hue and each one
looks a splendid pearl fastened in the
crown of each of the flowers of the
crown imperial which, hanging down,
only display the pearly honey drops
when we look up into the flower. The
buttercup is one of the most interesting
flowers that secrete nectar. It belongs
to the <i>Ranunculus</i>, or crowfoot
family, which numbers many wild and
some of the choicest of cultivated flowers.
The nectar-cups are under the
petals, and the mission of the flowers
seems to be to feed the bees. It is
well known that beyond the realm of
romance and poetry the buttercup is a
plant abhorred by the cow that gives
the milk that makes the butter. The
lovely yellow color of the buttercup no
doubt suggested the name. Apiarists
know that certain kinds of flowers make
certain grades of honey. They know
also that while the bee makes its honey
from the flower, it will also make honey
from sugar and molasses. The drainings
of molasses casks are given the
bee for winter food, and it is one of
the unsolved mysteries how the bee
makes its honey. The nectar in the
flower is not honey. The bee makes
the honey from what is abstracted from
the flower, and also preserves life and
makes honey from sweets that are given
it for food. Buckwheat is an example
of dark, rich honey and white clover
and raspberry blooms of clear, translucent
honey. Also the fact is, that abstracting
the nectar in no wise impairs
the beauty nor the fruitfulness of the
flower. Instance the rich, productive
buckwheat, how profusely it yields its
flower; and raspberries ripen sweet and
juicy from vines that have had the
bees hovering over the snowy blooms
from the time they open till the berries
form. Honey bees are not always safe
in their selection of flowers to feed
upon, for Xenophon, in his "Retreat of
the Ten Thousand," describes the honey
of Trebizond as having produced the
effect of temporary madness, or drunkenness,
upon the whole army. Mr. Abbott,
writing from the same country in
1833, says he witnessed the same effects
of honey upon those partaking of
it as Xenophon describes.</p>

<p>This would indicate that the honey
undergoes some chemical change in
the making, as the bees, in these instances,
were not injured by the flowers,
yet the honey they made from them
was injurious to man.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS favorite singer and cage bird
is a native of the Canary Islands,
Madeiras, Azores and other
small islands near the western
coast of Africa. The islands are in the
latitude of Florida and the climate may
be said to be of a tropical character,
though varied by lofty mountains. The
canary in its native habitat is chiefly
found in the mountainous districts,
often several thousand feet above the
level of the sea. The wild birds mate
about the latter part of March. The
nest is built in the tall trees of the
evergreen species, frequently in the tops
of these trees, and never less than eight
or ten feet from the ground. We have
seen it stated that they build on the
ground, but this has been found to be
an error.</p>

<p>The first canaries known to Europeans
were brought from there by a
merchant ship trading with the Canary
Islands as a part of her cargo, several
thousand of these birds having been
trapped in the hope that they could be
sold for a good price as song-birds.
The ship was wrecked near the coast
of Italy, but by the thoughtfulness of a
sailor the cage containing the birds was
opened and the birds liberated. They
flew at once to the nearest point of
land, which happened to be the island
of Elba. The climate was so propitious
that the canaries multiplied rapidly.
In a very short time their superiority
as songsters attracted attention and
their domestication followed. The
shipwreck referred to occurred early in
the sixteenth century. The Italians
were the first to breed these birds,
and they were by them shipped to Russia,
Germany, Belgium, and England.
They were first described in an English
book on natural history in 1610. The
rage for breeding the canary with home
birds became curiously popular and resulted
in a curious intermixture of colors.
In Italy they were bred with the
citril and serin; in Germany with the
linnet, green finch, and siskin. Mr. C.
N. Page says, in his "Feathered Pets,"
a very valuable book for bird fanciers,
that in an English book published in
1709 there are twenty-eight varieties
of canaries mentioned, comprising
nearly all those known at the present
time and some which have become extinct.
The climate has also had much
to do with the change of color in these
birds. The canary, which in its native
home at Teneriffe is almost brown, becomes
yellow and sometimes nearly
white after being bred a few years in
France, and it has been observed by
naturalists that the winter fur of animals
and feathers of birds become
thicker and lighter in color in proportion
to the coldness of the climate
which they inhabit.</p>

<p>In England and Germany canary societies
have existed for upwards of a
century, and annual shows or exhibitions
are held with prizes offered for
the best birds.</p>

<p>Of the many varieties of canaries the
most popular in the United States is
the German. It is smaller than the
English canary and is a much finer
singer, being bred and trained for song
and not for size. They are called Hartz
Mountain canaries, and experts consider
them the most satisfactory bird
for the people. They are bred by the
peasants in ordinary living-rooms high
up among the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
These birds are even more
hardy than the American-bred canaries.
They are brilliant singers. We had
one for five years, and while its voice
was wonderfully clear, full, and musical,
it was too loud and was not admired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
by our neighbors. The shrill and
piercing note of some of this species
renders them somewhat objectionable
as house pets. The birds are happy in
the cage, require very little care, and if
properly attended to are said to be free
from diseases. Most of the Hartz
Mountain canaries are somewhat mottled
with dark, greenish-brown, though
many of the birds are clear yellow, and
few have crests. In the canary-breeding
section of Germany, almost every
family keeps a few cages of these birds,
or has a room devoted to their breeding.
The German people are very fond
of birds and there are many of them in
the United States who have many cages
of rare specimens.</p>

<p>Milwaukee supplies the United States
with the bulk of the Hartz Mountain
canaries, and there is no great crime in
the deception, for the Milwaukee bird
is really an improvement on the imported
article, having just as fine a
voice and being much hardier.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that the imported
singer loses the power of transmitting
his voice to the young after
passing through an American winter.
This is the case also, it is said, with
Tyrolean singers who come to this
country, their voices losing the peculiar
yodling quality when they have
been here a year. The native canary
is hardier than the imported one, and,
with proper training, is every bit as
good a singer.</p>

<p>Before they are mated the hen birds
are kept in separate cages in the music
room, carefully fed and made to listen
to the music of the singers and the machine
used in training their voices. In
this way the hen is enabled to transmit
the best musical quality to her offspring.
The music-room is a large one,
with a south exposure, and is kept with
the same scrupulous neatness as the
breeding-room. In the corner of this
room is the bird organ, and with it the
little birds are given their vocal training.</p>

<p>When the machine is started the notes
emitted are wonderfully like the song
of the untutored canary. These notes
are known to bird-trainers by the term
<i>pfeiffen</i>. Gradually the whistle strikes
onto a different line. It is an improvement
over the <i>pfeiffen</i>, and is called
the <i>klingel rolle</i>. A higher step still is
called the <i>klingel</i>, and a still higher
step <i>hohl klingel</i>. Lastly comes what
is called <i>hol rollen</i>, and a bird whose
voice has been developed up to that
point is worth $50 in the market any
day.</p>

<p>In this country there are only three
importers of canaries. Each of these
firms employs "bird-pickers" who travel
over the mountains in Germany and
gather together a supply of birds which
are selected from the stocks of the
small breeders.</p>

<p>There are several varieties of English
canaries. The Norwich is a general favorite.
It takes its name from the city
of Norwich, where for generations it
has been bred and cultivated. It has a
brilliant, deep, reddish-yellow plumage.
It is regarded as the most beautiful of
all the canaries. Its color is frequently
so dark that it is called the red canary.
This color is produced artificially by
feeding them during the moulting season
a large amount of cayenne pepper
mixed with hard boiled egg and cracker
crumbs.</p>

<p>Canaries have many pretty ways and
can be taught many pretty tricks. One
that belonged to the writer had been
deprived of its feet. Its wing feathers
never grew out, hence it could not fly
or perch and was obliged to stump
about on the floor like an old veteran
on his crutch. But it was healthy and
vigorous, and so pugnacious that on
our return, after the day's absence, it
would fly at us, or try to, poor thing,
and peck our outstretched fingers, even
while taking offered hemp seed greedily.
The bird watched and waited for
our coming and we became so much
attached to it that its death was a real
loss.</p>

      <div class="verse">As full as larger creatures' arts.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The nest of the canary is a pretty,
neatly formed structure of any soft
material it can find. Five bluish eggs
are usually laid, and three or four
broods are raised between February
and September, though the female will
sometimes persist in building until
much later.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">"I AM SO SORRY," wrote a little
girl from Tarrytown, N. Y., to the
editor of <span class="sc">Birds and all Nature</span>,
"not to find in your magazine any
more the bird-talks to the little folks.
I used to read them with so much interest.
Are there to be no more of
them?"</p>

<p>Other little folks have written to the
editor in much the same strain, so that
this month the paroquet will speak for
himself.</p>

<p>"From my photograph," he says;
"you will notice that I am fond of gay
dress, green, blue, yellow, orange-chrome,
and red being my favorite colors.
From my brilliant coat you would
judge me to be a tropical bird, but I'm
not. I was born and raised in the
United States, as was my family, therefore
I am an American citizen.</p>

<p>"In appearance I greatly resemble my
cousin, the glib-tongued parrot, but for
some reason, though my tongue is thick
and short like his, and my bill as
charmingly curved, I cannot talk&mdash;that
is, not to be understood by the human
family, I mean, for among ourselves we
keep up a very lively conversation, in
very loud tones&mdash;a mark we think, as do
some other folk, of good breeding. On
the other hand there are people unreasonable
enough not to like it, and
they say we 'scream' and that our notes
are 'ear-splitting' and that, though we
are beautiful to look upon and extremely
docile, our voices render us
undesirable as cage birds or pets.
The idea! As though we do not consider
that very fortunate!&mdash;for a cage is
a prison, no matter if the bars are gilded.
For my part I prefer to be free even if
I do have to hustle for a living and, between
you and me, I think that a bird
that can screech and doesn't screech
when shut up in a little cage doesn't deserve
to live. He ought to be killed and
stuffed and set up in a museum for people
to gape at. Don't you think so, too?</p>

<p>"It is a great pity, but we paroquets
are fast being exterminated. In some
regions, where less than twenty-five
years ago we were very plentiful, not a
paroquet is now to be seen. We were
once quite common in Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, Pennsylvania, and other parts
of the United States. We are now to
be found, in diminished numbers,
in remote localities only of the lower
Mississippi Valley and the Gulf States
and in some regions of Florida. To
escape from our enemy, the plume-hunter,
we make our homes in practically
uninhabitable regions. That is a
long word for you little folks, but spell
it out slowly, as I did, and you will understand
what it means.</p>

<p>"Our nesting-time is during February
and March. Then colonies of us paroquets,
sometimes numbering a thousand,
flock to a cypress swamp and
build our flimsy nests in forks of trees,
near the end of a slender, horizontal
branch. Often there are fifty nests in
one small tree, each containing from
four to five pretty, greenish-white eggs.
It is a good thing we build our nests in
wild and unsettled places, for they are
so flimsy that the eggs are plainly visible
from beneath. What a temptation
to the bad boy they would be, and to
the bad man, also! Some paroquets,
however, choose a hollow tree in which
to deposit their eggs.</p>

<p>"Well, I have told you about all I
know of myself and family, so will close
by reciting in my very loudest and
prettiest screech, so that all the neighborhood
may hear, a few lines about a
Mr. Macaw who was silly enough, after
escaping from a cage, to return to it.
He is a cousin of mine, a <i>distant</i> cousin,
for he was born in South America; but
he wears the same colored coat and
vest as I do, his tongue is just as thick,
and his bill curves like a parrot's, also:</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">FEW birds indeed can lay claim to
such beautiful and varied dress
as our native paroquet. But for
this dress and for certain habits
which will be spoken of more particularly
a little later, he has had to pay a
most severe penalty. Once an abundant
bird over the whole southeastern
portion of the country, ranging commonly
as far north as southern Ohio
and Illinois, and sometimes even as far
north as southern Michigan and New
York, and as far west as eastern Colorado,
his numbers and range have been
reduced to a few individuals in the
wilds of the Indian Territory and the
adjacent parts of Texas, and the fastnesses
of the Florida swamps. The region
over which he ranged so numerously
in advance of civilization, suffers
a distinct loss in his extermination.</p>

<p>It is hardly fair to lay the blame for
the disappearance of this bird solely
at the door of the plume-hunters and
collectors, for it must be admitted that
the paroquet was a real menace to the
fruit-grower and farmer when he was
abundant. Even his extreme fondness
for the fruit of the cockle-bur, thistle,
and a few other noxious plants, could
hardly atone for the complete ruin of
the apple crop, or his serious inroads
upon the wheat or corn field. One
could not stand tamely by while a flock
of these birds, with all their beauty,
stripped his orchard of every blossom
and bud.</p>

<p>The food of the paroquet was entirely
vegetable, consisting of the seed of the
cockle-bur, as already stated, sycamore
and cypress seed, pecan and beech nuts,
the fruit of the pawpaw, mulberries,
wild grapes and various other wild
fruits as well as cultivated fruits, the
seeds of pine cones and the burgrass.
Grains of various kinds were eaten
while in the milk, and Mr. Frank M.
Chapman found them eating the seeds
of thistles. So varied a diet enabled
these birds to pass the winter in the
northern parts of their range as well as
farther south. It has been stated that
paroquets have been found hibernating
in hollow trees in the coldest winters.
If they were actually found in such
places they were undoubtedly simply
taking refuge from some severe storm,
to issue forth again when it had passed.</p>

<p>The paroquet's strong, hooked beak
was probably so formed for the cutting
of stems and husks of plants and the
crushing of seeds and nuts, but he also
finds it useful in climbing about trees
as an aid to his yoked feet, and as
a partial support while he sleeps in
some hollow tree, the bill being hooked
over a projection or into a convenient
crevice.</p>

<p>Major Charles E. Bendire describes
the flight as undulating, like that of the
woodpeckers, but very swift, accompanied
by a continuous chattering while
on the wing. The birds remain together
in flocks of from six to twenty
individuals (before they became so
scarce, by hundreds), and are very devoted
to each other. The cries of a
wounded companion will always recall
the whole flock to his aid, thus
enabling the hunter to kill every bird
in the flock. It is this characteristic,
no doubt, which has very largely caused
the rapid disappearance of the birds
before advancing civilization.</p>

<p>The nesting-habits of the paroquet
are in some doubt, but the evidence
seems to indicate that the birds may
rear their brood either in a cavity in a
tree or build a slight nest after the
fashion of the mourning-dove. Such
nests seem to be largely confined to
the cypress swamps of Florida. The
eggs, several of which have been secured
from birds in confinement, are
pure glossy white, smooth, and rather
ovate in shape, somewhat larger than
those of the mourning-dove, and averaging
1.39 × 1.07 of an inch.</p>

<p>These birds seem to nest in colonies,
a fact which led Major Bendire to suggest
that when the colonies were very
large the birds were forced to build
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
open nests from a lack of suitable nesting-places
in cavities.</p>

<p>The cry is described as "shrill and
disagreeable, a kind of grating, metallic
shriek." One call resembles the shrill
cry of a goose. They sometimes give
utterance to low conversational notes
while perched.</p>

<p>It seems almost incredible that
scarcely more than half a century has
witnessed the passing of a once abundant
species of our native bird. Like
the bison, the paroquet has been swept
away by the rushing tide of progress,
leaving only fading memories where
once they were characteristic features
of the landscape. We may congratulate
ourselves that there are few of our
birds and mammals that find it so impossible
to survive the advance of civilization.</p>

things of this country that are

more wonderful than anything
of the kind in the world. They have
recited in school such a number of
statements about the Mississippi river
that the great stream has become one
of the essential points of our nation's
honor.</p>

drew somewhat on his imagination

story of his rescue by Pocahontas; that
perhaps, after all, we did not whip the
entire British nation twice in open warfare&mdash;but
it will be hard to make any
native-born American admit that the
Mississippi river is not the longest in
the world.</p>

<p>He may listen to your argument in
favor of the Nile or the Amazon, but
he will tell you that he still thinks that
if the Mississippi had been measured
correctly at first, taking the source of
the Missouri as the source of the Mississippi,
we would have been the possessors
of the longest river on earth.</p>

<p>And if that should seem a trifle
weak he will at once tell you that
the great river is more wonderful
than all others because its source is
several hundred feet nearer the center
of the earth than its mouth. In other
words, the river flows up hill. The
curvature of the earth is not the true
arc of a circle from the equator to the
poles, for the axis of the earth is
shorter than its diameter at the equator
by about twenty-six miles. It is
thirteen miles less from the north pole
to the center of the earth than from
any point on the equator to the center.
So the river flows towards the
equator with an apparent fall as estimated
from the sea-level, but with an
actual rising away from the earth's
center just as the sea rises round this
shoulder of the earth.</p>

<p>So the Mississippi is a source of joy
and boastful conversation to every citizen
of the United States.</p>

<p>The Acadian settlers of Nova Scotia
whose praises have been sung by Longfellow
in his "Evangeline", were the
earliest to reclaim land from the sea in
America. Being weaker than those
who used the ax to fell the giants of
the forest primeval, they were more
skillful with the spade. They took advantage
of the extremely high tides of
the Bay of Fundy and its branches, and
when the water was low threw up embankments
which prevented the sea
from covering part of the rich red mud
flats before the village of Grand Pre.</p>

<p>At the time of their painful dispersion
they had secured all the land between
the original shore and the island
which stood out in the basin of Minas.</p>

<p>Though they could not take these
rich lands with them in their exile,
many of them carried the knowledge
of dike-building down to the lower
courses of the Mississippi, and taught
the rest of the Americans there how to
get the fat lands of the river bottoms
by means of levees.</p>

<p>When General Pakenham gave up
his life and lost a fine British army to
General Jackson after the treaty of
peace had been signed in the War of
1812, his right rested on the bank of
the Mississippi where there was a levee
a little over five feet high.</p>

<p>This levee cut off the waters from
spreading when the freshet was on. It
was sufficient at that time. Extensions
of levee work cut off more and more of
the bottom-lands from the spread of the
high waters till now nearly four-fifths
of the area over which the waters of
the June freshet used to spread are protected
by these structures.</p>

<p>The levees are not now the low banks
of earth which once kept the waters
back. The great mass of water that
comes from the melting of snows in
the Alleghenies and the Rockies must
either spread out or pile up. Confining
within less than a mile of width a
surplus of water that formerly spread
itself for a hundred miles makes it necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
for the water to rise and rush
forward with greater violence.</p>

<p>Year by year the levees have crept
up the sides of the great river, choking
it into narrow walls. Year after year it
has risen in its wrath and burst its
bounds to destroy the cities and plantations
which have been fattening in
the mud of its alluvial flats. Every
year the levees are put up higher, and
as the works extend to the northward
and more effectually close up the
southern places of spreading out there
is an average increase in the stage of
high water and in velocity of the current.
When it was allowed to wander
over great stretches of country the
water seemed in no hurry to get to the
gulf, but now it goes tearing madly
through its narrowed banks, and it has
become a question with Congress which
will take much deliberation and experiment
as well as great financial outlay
to solve.</p>

<p>It has been proposed that great reservoirs
be constructed in the mountain
districts to hold back the waters that
are wasted in their rush to the sea. If
there could be made in the Bad Lands
in northern Wyoming a reservoir that
would hold all the waters accumulating
there during the months of spring, that
reservoir would "skim off" the top of
the Mississippi river two thousand
miles away and save the people there
from the perils that threaten them
whenever the water mounts toward the
danger-point.</p>

<p>It would require a vast artificial lake
to hold these waters, but there are
mountain ranges that could be utilized
to form the barriers and the land taken
from profitable grazing could be paid
for with much less expense than the
cost of one inundation of Mississippi
bottom lands when a levee breaks.</p>

<p>Instead of one vast reservoir it will
probably be found expedient to lay out
a great number of works for retaining
the western waters, as well as others in
the eastern mountains and some in the
beds of other tributary rivers whose
sources are in the great basin between.</p>

<p>If these stores of water could be
utilized for irrigation it is probable that
the works would eventually pay for
themselves in the increase in value of
cultivated lands. The water at present
is largely wasted because it rushes past
the lands that need it before their distress
of drouth comes, and its bulk is
fairly spent when they need most the
water that has passed. Adequate systems
of reservoirs would also prevent
largely the wearing away of banks and
the changing of the course of the channel
and even of the river itself which
now sometimes tears away the foundations
of cities, obliterates landmarks,
and carries off bodily many well-tilled
farms. Navigation could be much improved
if the stages of high water could
be moderated.</p>

<p>The Kansas farmer complained that
the Missouri river is too thick to drink
and too thin to plow. Control of surplus
water near the sources would
make this river so moderate that commerce
would move along its surface.
Varying moods and shifting sands now
prevent navigation on that great river
almost completely.</p>

<p>The Chinese have a problem similar
to ours. Their government esteems
their board of public works as one of
the highest in their country. This
board has charge of the canals and embankments
along the great rivers. But
it is a Chinese board.</p>

<p>The Hoang Ho resembles our great
water course in that it rises in mountains
and flows for hundreds of miles
through comparatively level country
in its lower courses. It deposits mud
along its way through the great plain
so that the people are continually
obliged to construct levees higher and
higher until nature no longer will put
up with such treatment and the great
yellow river breaks its bonds and
travels across the country to find a
new outlet at the seacoast.</p>

<p>In 2500 years it has altered its general
course nine times with terrible destruction
of life and property. Its last
great breach occurred in 1887, when it
tore through the empire a new channel
that caused its waters to reach the sea
through the mouth of the Yangtse-kiang
five hundred miles away from its
present mouth. More than a million
lives were lost and the devastation of
the country has never been approximately
estimated. The gap torn in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
its embankment was two-thirds of a
mile in width. Efforts to close it were
ineffective except in low water, and
when it was at last almost accomplished
the celestials had a narrow but constantly
deepening breach to mend,
its depth during the last days of the
work being so great that a torrent
sixty feet deep fought with gigantic
might against the endeavors of the
men. At times the bed of this river
has actually stood above the level of
the surrounding country, its walls having
risen with the rise of the bed due
to the deposit of mud till it seemed as
if the great river had risen to take a
look over the surrounding plain to see
where it could wreak the direst vengeance
on those who prevented it from
running unvexed to the sea.</p>

<p>We may learn from the wide experience
of the Chinese that there is no
safety for us in merely building higher
the walls to restrain the Mississippi.
The nation must take hold of the matter
with a strong hand. Possibly forty
or fifty millions will be necessary to
construct the works which will moderate
the flow and distribute its waters
to those who need it in their irrigating
ditches. Even though it cost thrice
the sum paid to Spain in settlement of
the Philippine question, the people
would more gladly give it.</p>

<p>Nothing short of a great ship canal
along the bed of the Mississippi will
satisfy Americans. There is but one
objection to the work, and that is its
great expense. But we have recently
seen that the cost of one great inundation
along the Brazos was far more
than the figures here named, and no
account need be made of the loss of
life and the suffering that followed
that great disaster.</p>

<p>Our great river must be controlled.
Not in the Chinese fashion, which we
know to be merely the storing of wrath
against the day of wrath, but it must
be done intelligently and with patience,
with faith in ourselves and a determination
to prevent the great loss
of life which will be imminent every
time there happens to be the coming
of a flood from the eastern mountains
and another from the western at the
same time.</p>

<p>Our great water way, when properly
controlled and protected by permanent
revetments and masonry, will furnish
the farmers of the great plains a natural
outlet to the sea for all their produce.
This will be monopolized by no
railway trust; no combination of steam-boat
men will put the farmer into the
hands of corporations seeking to rob
him of the best part of his crop on the
way to market, for there will be docks
along every man's water front, and
the rudest flatboat will always rely
upon the favoring current to bear its
cargo to the sides of independent vessels
plying the seas to the uttermost
parts of the earth.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">NATURALISTS, as well as many
ordinary observers, it is said,
recognize numerous varieties
among the chipmunks of the
United States, founded principally on
the markings of the fur; for in their
habits they are all very similar. Elliott
Coues describes four varieties found in
this country.</p>

<p>The American chipmunk, hackee, or
chipping squirrel (<i>Tamias lysteri</i>) is
distributed all over the United States.
The face is of a reddish brown tint,
with darker spots on the forehead and
cheeks; the nape of the neck is ashen
gray, the hind-quarters reddish brown,
the under surface whitish; there is a
dark-brown stripe on the back, a black
stripe over the eye, with white above
and below it, and there is a wide white
side-streak edged with blackish brown;
the upper surface of the tail is dark-brown,
the base being grayish yellow,
the tip whitish and the lower surface a
ruddy hue.</p>

<p>This description may seem superfluous,
in view of our picture of the
lively little animal; we think, however,
it may induce closer observation of the
markings of its fur.</p>

<p>The chipmunk is visible at all seasons
of the year, but late in summer it
may be seen running about, "its cheek
pouches filled and its eyes beaming
with the satisfaction which its riches
afford it." According to the different
months in which they mature, it gathers
its varied stores, for the most part
consisting of buckwheat, hazelnuts,
maple seeds, and corn. During the
winter it hibernates to some extent, but
it seems to stand in need of food during
the whole winter. Audubon dug up a
burrow in January, and at the depth of
about four feet he found a large nest of
leaves and grass in which were three
chipmunks; others seemed to have disappeared
in the lateral passages at the
approach of the diggers. The animals
were overcome with sleep and not very
active, but they were not as torpid as
true hibernating animals are, and they
snapped viciously at the naturalist, who
tried to handle them. The animal
does not become torpid before November.
It does not leave its subterranean
home during the winter, but keeps a
passage open. When the snow melts
it begins its activity above ground.</p>

<p>The young are born in May, and a
second litter usually in August. It is
said the males engage in fierce combats
during the breeding-season.</p>

<p>The farmer is not very friendly to
this animal, which he regards as a pest.
It is hunted extensively. A whole
army of enemies is constantly engaged
in its pursuit. "Boys utilize it to practice
the noble sport of hunting; weasels
pursue it both on and under the ground;
cats deem it a prey equally as good as
rats and mice, and all larger birds of
prey carry it off whenever they have a
chance. One of these birds has even
gained for itself the name of squirrel-hawk,
because of its attacks on the
chipmunk." The rattlesnake, according
to the observations of Geyer, also
follows the poor little creature with a
great deal of perseverance. Winter
often causes sad havoc among the
numerous young brood born in summer.
Yet they are very plentiful, at
least in favorable years, the great
fecundity of the female making up for
the losses. Their chief protection
against enemies is the difficulty in
finding them and the amazing nimbleness
they display as they dart between
and under hedges like wrens.</p>

<p>The beauty and gracefulness of the
ground-squirrels render them interesting
pets, but as they never become
quite tame, are timid and addicted to
biting, and gnaw everything in the
cage they are not very desirable to
keep. Their care presents no difficulties,
and they thrive well on the
simplest diet of grain and fruit.</p>

<p>Greenwood Cemetery, Brooklyn, N. Y.,
is suffering for the second time in
its history from a too great increase in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
its colony of chipmunks. Eighteen
years ago they became such a nuisance
that a trapper was employed, and 28,000
small striped pelts were the results
of his first year's work.</p>

<p>This year it was noticed that an unusual
number were about, even in the
early spring, when the chipmunks first
appear after a winter's sleep. Now it
is estimated that there are at least
20,000 chipmunks in the cemetery, and
a great deal of damage has been done.
Through their burrowing habits they
have undermined the gravestones, and
even in many cases caused graves to
sink in, when rainwater has helped to
hollow out their burrows.</p>

<p>The chief enemies of the chipmunks
are the florists, for the animals nip
growing plants at the roots to reach
the sap. One Brooklyn florist says
that since Decoration Day he has had
to put in 250 new plants to keep up an
original plat of 150. Florists with contracts
to keep graves in condition have
entered strong protests, but outside
florists, who work by the piece, have
been making money.</p>

<p>The eight special policemen on the
grounds have been furnished with poisoned
nuts to scatter about. No diminution
has yet appeared in the chipmunk
army, as they reproduce three or
four times a year and increase fourfold
in a season if not checked. But if poison
fails another trapper may be called
in.</p>

<p><i>Our Animal Friends</i> says that some children
were feeding chickens with some
stale bread one day, and two or three
chipmunks appeared. They wanted
the bread, too, and every time the children
threw a bit down, both chickens
and chipmunks would make a rush for
it; and nearly always the chipmunks
got it. One of them was particularly
smart; he gathered all his pieces in a
little pile between two stones, and he
seemed to keep one eye on them
and the other on the lookout for
fresh pieces all the time. At last
one of the chickens saw the pile and
made a run for it, but its owner got
there first, and he just sat right down
on the top of the heap and <i>chattered</i>.
The chicken kept on coming nearer
and looking rather as if he would fight
for it, so Mr. Chipmunk sat straight up,
twirled his tail, and just seemed to
shake with anger. Then another came
along to help him, and the two tucked
all the pieces into their pockets and
off they darted, leaving the poor
chicken looking awfully disappointed.</p>

  THREATENED EXTERMINATION OF THE FUR SEAL.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_t.jpg" width="58" height="70"
    alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE fur-seal herds of the north
Pacific breed on islands situated
in Bering Sea and belonging to
the United States and Russia.
On these islands, Pribilof and Komandorski,
for nearly a hundred years
they have received all necessary protection
from attacks on land. The existence
of the herds, however, demands
the further protection of the females
when they are feeding or migrating in
the open sea beyond the usual three-mile
limit of territorial jurisdiction.
The animals visit certain islands in the
summer. They breed on them and
make them their home. The young
remain there until driven away by the
storms of winter. The adults leave the
islands in summer only to feed, going
to a distance of one hundred to two
hundred miles for that purpose. The
winter is spent by the entire herd in
the open sea, their migrations extending
from one thousand to twenty-five
hundred miles to the southward of
their breeding-resorts.</p>

<p>For many years, both under Russian
and American control, the herds have,
as I have said, received absolute protection
on land, the killing for skins
being restricted to the bands of superfluous
males. As only one male in
about thirty is able to maintain himself
on a rookery or to rear a family, about
twenty-nine out of every thirty are
necessarily superfluous. The survival
of one male in a hundred is sufficient
for all actual needs of propagation.
The young males on land are as easily
handled and selected as sheep, and no
diminution whatever to the increase of
the herd has arisen from selective land-killing.
The number of females in the
herd bearing young each year was, in
the earlier days, about 650,000 on the
American islands and perhaps half as
many on the Russian. The numbers of
males and of young were together
about twice as many more. This gave
an annual total on the American, or
Pribilof, islands of about 2,000,000 animals
of all classes, while on the Russian,
or Komandorski, islands there
were about 1,000,000.</p>

<p>About 1884 different persons, known
as pelagic sealers&mdash;chiefly citizens of
Canada, but some of them from the
United States&mdash;began to attack the
herd in Bering Sea. Here no selective
killing was possible. The females were
always in the numerical majority, as
the males had become less numerous
on account of land-killing and as they
left the islands less frequently in the
summer. Each female above two years,
when taken in the sea, died with her
unborn young. Most of the adult females
so taken after July 1 had left
their young on the islands, and these
orphan pups invariably starved to
death.</p>

<p>Beginning with this increase of pelagic
sealing in 1884 the fur-seal herds
rapidly declined in numbers. In 1897
there were about 130,000 breeding-seals
on the American islands, or about 400,000
animals of all classes, while on the
Russian islands there were less than
65,000 breeding-animals, or less than
200,000 of all classes.</p>

<p>For this great reduction in numbers
there is but one cause&mdash;a cause plain,
self-evident, and undeniable&mdash;and that
is the slaughter of breeding-females at
a rate largely in excess of the rate of
increase. While other causes have been
assigned, none of them is worthy of the
slightest consideration in explaining
the decline.</p>

<p>Even in 1893 it was evident, to all
capable of forming an opinion, that
pelagic sealing was the sole known
cause of the decline of the fur-seal
herds. It was also evident that as an
industry it must be self-destructive,
since, if permitted to exist on any
scale which would make it profitable,
it must destroy the herd on which it
operated.&mdash;<i>"Lessons of the Paris Tribunal
of Arbitration," by President David Starr
Jordan, in Forum.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE peach (<i>Amygdalus persica, L.</i>),
is one of our most important
and best-known fruits.</p>

<p>It is not found in the wild state,
in its present form, though in some
localities it propagates itself, having
escaped from cultivation.</p>

<p>It is probably a native of China,
where it has been cultivated for centuries
and where it is said to reach its
greatest perfection, although Darwin
holds that the evidence seems to indicate
that the wild almond of Persia is
the original source of the cultivated
almond, the peach, and the nectarine.
The specific name <i>persica</i>, has its origin
in the fact that the peach was obtained
from Persia, both by the Romans and
the Greeks.</p>

<p>Dr. Willis tells us that "it was introduced
into Italy from Persia by the
Romans, in the reign of Claudius
Cæsar. It was introduced into Great
Britain during the sixteenth century,
and thence brought in 1680 by the
settlers of Virginia to America."</p>

<p>The number of varieties seems to be
unlimited. Over four hundred have
been catalogued, though less than one
hundred of these are constant. The
nectarine is considered a variety and
closely related to the peach and the
plum, the apricot, and the cherry.</p>

<p>The tree itself, when bearing its beautiful
rose-colored, five-petaled flowers,
is highly ornamental. It seldom grows
higher than twenty feet and its
branches form a symmetrical top. One
very ornamental variety produces
double flowers and bright, shining
leaves, but no fruit.</p>

<p>This valuable plant is generally
placed in the family <i>Rosaceæ</i>, which includes
many species of economic and
ornamental importance. Besides those
already mentioned, here belong the
rose, the strawberry, the raspberry, the
blackberry, the apple, the pear, and the
quince, as well as many beautiful wild
forms.</p>

<p>The thousand or more species usually
classed in this family may be
readily separated into distinct groups,
to which are given distinct family
names by some authorities. Thus, the
peach, the cherry, the plum, and the
almond, which resemble each other in
regard to the structure of their fruits
and in their chemical constituents, may
be placed in a family by themselves.</p>

<p>It is of interest to note that this luscious
fruit was not always considered
free from noxious qualities. Pliny
states that it was considered by some
that its presence in Egypt was due to
its introduction there by the Persian
king for the purpose of poisoning his
enemies.</p>

<p>The Chinese writings refer to the
peach as early as the fifth century before
Christ, and it is given the name
"tao" by Confucius. We are also told
that in these writings "the peach tree
holds the same place that the tree
of knowledge does in the sacred scriptures,
and that the golden Hesperides,
apples of the heathen, hold among the
western nations."</p>

<p>In Chinese mythology a peach tree
is mentioned which was thought to
possess the power of causing immortality
but which produced its fruit but
once in a thousand years, and another,
which grew on a mountain and
which existed in the early history of
China, was said to be guarded by a
number of demons.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">UGH! The ugly worm! Crush it!
Wait a moment, listen, while I
tell you a more excellent way.
Notice on what your worm is
feeding; take a branch of it home and
place it in a bottle of water with the
worm on it; then place the bottle with
its contents in a large box, fastening a
wire securely over the box, to prevent
the escape; then watch your worm. Perhaps
your worm will be the one so often
found on the milkweed (<i>asclepias</i>) with
black and yellow stripes around his
body, two little horns in front on his
head and one at the tail. If you keep
him well supplied with fresh leaves, in
a short time he will eat all he wishes
and then, and not until then, will he
leave the plant on which he is feeding
and travel many a long journey up and
down and all around the box, until you
may imagine he has gone crazy from
his confinement; but that is not the case,
as you will soon see. When he finds
just the right place, he will remain quite
still to all appearances, but really he is
very busy with his bobbin of silk and
glue bottle weaving a small silken mat
and fastening it very securely to the
top of the box, and the next thing you
will see him hanging by his tail from
this mat, with his head recurved. Watch
him and you will notice that he makes
little jerky motions. For about twenty-four
hours he remains in that same position,
when suddenly he drops down
his head so that he hangs straight down;
now don't leave him for a moment, for
very soon after taking that position,
his black and yellow striped coat begins
to split open, right between those
two little black horns on the head, as
evenly as though cut with a sharp knife
and a pale green globular object comes
into sight. With a few contortions of the
body the little fellow pushes up his old
coat, folding each stripe, just as Japanese
lanterns fold up, then with a dexterous
movement he fastens the end of
his beautiful green chrysalis to the mat,
dropping his old clothes, so closely
compacted together that you would
hardly recognize them. Now for two
hours he exercises by little shrugs until
the beautiful green chrysalis hangs complete,
with gold band and pure gold
spots, the most beautiful chrysalis I
ever saw. Everyone exclaims, "How
beautiful!" and wonders how an ugly
worm could so transform itself into a
thing of beauty.</p>

<p>For ten days we can see no change in
the looks of this chrysalis; then it grows
darker and darker until you can distinguish
the veins on the wings of the
future butterfly. Then this little fellow,
tired of his close quarters, opens
the door of his beautiful chrysalis and
creeps out, clinging fast to the empty
nest. O, what tiny wings! But as you
watch they dry out and lengthen to three
times their first size and you behold the
beautiful large Viceroy&mdash;orange-red
wings with black lines along the nervures
and a row of white spots along
the outer margin, his black body beautifully
spotted with white.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you may find, on the carrots
in your garden, a worm with black
and green stripes around his body, the
black stripe being decorated with yellow
spots. He will spin a long silken mat
the length of his body and to that mat
fasten a swing to hang around his body,
so that by using a little glue at the end of
his body the swing will hold his chrysalis
in place. This chrysalis is not as
beautiful as the Viceroy, but very interesting
in its odd shape and in its development
and will well repay all the
interest taken in it. Perhaps you may
be surprised by not seeing a beautiful
butterfly emerge from your chrysalis,
but instead an Ichneumon fly, for
often the Ichneumon fly deposits her
egg in the caterpillar's back, and he
can not say her nay; after he is nicely
settled in his chrysalis this egg hatches
and develops rapidly, needing so much
food that nothing is left of the poor
caterpillar or worm, but the fly prospers
and soon comes forth full-grown, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
a round hole which he makes in the
side of the chrysalis.</p>

<p>Each variety of worm and caterpillar
will reward you with a different chrysalis
or cocoon. If you are not sure of
your worm place a box of dirt in your
box, for some worms go into the dirt to
make the great change. After watching
these changes you, too, will say:
"Don't crush the worms! For are they
not a symbol of our own death and resurrection
when we shall awake in His
glorious likeness?"</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the <i>Bulletin of the Michigan Ornithological
Club</i> H. S. Warren says
that nature and nature-worship
form the center of all the life of
the ancient Finns, and he quotes freely
from Crawford's translation of "The
Kalevala," the national epic of Finland.
He says that, "as the English
language is not strong in diminutives,
and therefore lacks some of the most
effective means for the expression of
affectionate, tender, and familiar relations,
in this respect all translations
from the Finnish into English must
fall short of the original, the former
being the language of a people who
live pre-eminently close to nature, and
are at home among the animals of the
wilderness, beasts and birds, winds and
woods and waters, falling snows and
flying sands." The metre is like that
of "Hiawatha," and is the characteristic
verse of the Finns.</p>

<p>As to birds, the duck lays the mundane
egg. "Then the water-mother
finds a place upon her own knees for
the duck to rest, where it lays an egg
which rolls into the sea. There it
breaks and is transformed into the
earth."</p>

<h2><a name="BIRD_NOTES" id="BIRD_NOTES"></a>BIRD NOTES.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/initial_f_alt.jpg" width="71" height="70"

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">F. SCHUYLER MATHEWS
says, in an article in <i>Popular
Science</i>, that the bird not only
possesses an ear for music but
the mind to produce it. As our own conventional
conception of music does not
at all correspond with the wild bird's
song, we are apt to consider the latter as
foreign to art. If, however, we choose to
consider the bird's conception of music
a lawless one, we must show that he
ignores all fundamental principles.
This it is impossible to do, for he invariably
resolves his effort to a perfectly
intelligible, logical, musical idea.
His music is, therefore, an art at least
in part.</p>

<p>"There are," Mr. Mathews continues,
"three woodland singers who will perfectly
illustrate my idea of the underlying
principle of bird-music. These
are the chickadee, the white-throated
sparrow, and the hermit-thrush. The
chickadee sings, or I may say, calls his
mate, with a perfect musical third, or
with two notes separated by a complete
musical interval. One bird may
sing the third; another may answer in
two descending notes. The remarkable
thing about this simple example of
melody is that the intervals between
the notes are correctly measured. The
result of his effort is a combination of
tones in perfect accord with a law of
music, and we are bound to accept it
as an example of melody.</p>

<p>"The chickadee, too, it should be remembered,
is not a high type of bird;
there are many steps of progression
between him and his more gifted cousins,
the thrushes, who are, indeed, musicians
of a high order. But, just here
I might as well call attention to the
fact that bird-music should not be
overestimated. Its character is fragmentary,
and its unconventionality is
obvious. The wild songs of the woods
and fields are not musical compositions;
they are at best but detached bits of
melody imperfectly conceived, although
often replete with the suggestions of a
complete musical idea.</p>

<p>"For instance, the white-throated
sparrow or Peabody bird sings a perfect
musical phrase which we may harmonize
as we please, because it certainly
suggests harmony. This is absolutely
no more than the bird sings. The musical
intervals, the pitch, and the lengths
of the notes are all correctly sustained.
In other words the bird suggests a complete
musical idea. But the little Peabody
bird seldom attempts a more difficult
or elaborate task. He knows his
limitations, and keeping within these,
his attempts are musically both consistent
and perfect. But let us turn
our attention to the more gifted songster
of the northern woods, the hermit
thrush. His capacity for simple melody,
his technical mastery of tone intervals
and note values, his phrasing
and his brilliancy as a performer, are
certainly not exceeded by any vocalist
of nature.</p>

<p>"But we must again studiously heed
the limitations of the bird's idea of music.
We are still in the presence of
the untamed singer, who is amenable
only to his own elastic laws. The hermit
thrush starts his song with a prolonged
keynote (often it is A) and then
springs upwards in thirds and fifths
with such rapidity and ease that we are
amazed at the accuracy of the performance.
Not only are the tones correctly
given, but they are embellished with
subsidiary or tributary tones.</p>

<p>"The last note, C, too faint to be heard
at any distance, is rendered in a gyrating,
suppressed way, impossible to describe,
but comparable to the soft tones
of a harmonicon. This note is an excellent
example of bird lawlessness regarding
music. It is quite antipodal
in character to the initial note (A) with
which the bird slowly begins, as if desirous
to found upon it a solid musical
phrase; but he fails most utterly at the
last and subsides into an exquisite,
elusive, compound tone&mdash;I do not know
what else to call it&mdash;which he rounds
off in a plaintive pianissimo. He is
not satisfied; he begins the same strain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
again, now in another key, and with no
better success in the final than in his
first effort. So he starts again with a
variation, this time striking an initial
note higher than before. Then he
makes another attempt; but still he
seems dissatisfied and, after a short
rest, three tiny high notes come from
his throat, full of perfect melody, as
simple as that of the chickadee."</p>

<p>The bird is a transcendentalist, ever
attempting what he cannot satisfactorily
accomplish, but failing, only to delight
us with the strange sweetness of
the imperfect performance. The highest
form of bird-music is unquestionably
revealed in the songs of the
thrushes. Here we have not only a
simple fundamental rule, amply demonstrated,
but also a partially developed
series of musical ideas, strung together
with a well-chosen relationship.
Of course, musically considered, the
development of the melody and the
connection of the phrases are more or
less imperfect; but that does not matter.
The truth is, the bird is an accomplished
singer who cares less for conventional
rules than he does for the essence,
or the soul of the music; but
above all he succeeds in inspiring his
listener. What more, may I ask, could
be expected of a musician?&mdash;<i>School

<p class="drop-cap">PROBABLY many a bright youth,
accustomed to wander through
the fields in enjoyment of nature,
has been thrilled with
pleasurable anticipations on finding, in
some outcrop of crystalline rock, a
mineral substance that glittered as
gold. That his anticipations were premature
should not deter the ambitious
youth. Men far beyond him in experience
have been deceived by that same
"fool's gold." History records that
shiploads of the valueless yellow iron
pyrites were sent to England by explorers
of America on the supposition
that they were accumulating gold.</p>

<p>Of the various compounds of iron
occurring in nature, but four may be
considered as relatively common&mdash;pyrite,
magnetite, hematite, and limonite.
Pyrite consists of iron and sulphur;
magnetite, hematite, and limonite are
oxides of iron. The first-named mineral
differs largely from the others in
external appearance as well as in composition.
The others are, however,
readily differentiated. We will discuss
each of the four minerals in the
order mentioned above.</p>

<p>The sulphide of iron, pyrite, occurs
in many crystalline rocks; but, owing
to the difficulty of separating the iron
and sulphur, is not used as an ore of
iron. The mineral much resembles in
external appearance a yellow ore of
copper, called chalcopyrite, from which
it may be distinguished in that it will
strike fire with steel. A specimen of
pyrites containing large crystals is an
interesting subject of study. These
crystals are cubical in shape, but generally
massed together so that no single
crystal form may be observed as
complete. Peculiar striations on the
cube faces may often be noted. The
striations of no two adjoining faces
are continuous; but rather a striation
of one face bears to that of another in
direction the relation of the stem of a
printed T to the top, or vice versa.
Owing to the affinity of each component
element for oxygen, pyrite often
changes to vitriol, or else forms the
oxide of iron, limonite, described below.</p>

<p>The black oxide of iron, magnetite,
occurs widely distributed. As its name
indicates, it sometimes displays the
properties of a magnet. If a fragment
of unequal dimensions be suspended
freely by a string, the longer
dimension will gradually swing into a
north and south direction. The property
possessed by magnetite of attracting
other bits of iron appears to have
been known to the ancients, and by
them the name lodestone was applied
to the mineral. Since the power to
attract other particles of iron is not
apparent in all specimens of magnetite
we must consider other more distinguishing
characteristics. The ore is
very heavy; particles of it are attracted
by an artificial magnet, in which regard
it differs from the other minerals
we have mentioned; if a piece of the
ore be scratched across the surface of
a harder substance, <i>e. g.</i>, smoky quartz,
a black "streak" will be left. Pure
magnetic iron ore is intensely black,
with no coloring.</p>

<p>In a series of ore beds formerly
operated by a mining company of
northern New York, four distinctions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of the crude ore were made, two varieties
of blue, one of black, and one of
gray. The blue coloring is apparently
due to the presence of impurities; the
black ore is evidently magnetite; and
the steel-gray mineral, failing in the
characteristic properties of magnetite,
finds its class place under hematite.
Hematite differs from magnetite in
representing a higher degree of oxidation.
It is often found, as indicated
above, in beds distributed in close
conjunction with those of magnetite.
This ore is a valuable source of iron.
Hematite commonly occurs in earthy
materials, as red ochre. Its streak is
red. All rocks of a reddish or red
color owe the color to this oxide of
iron.</p>

<p>When hematite rusts, the brownish-yellow
or yellow iron oxide, limonite,
results. The streak of limonite is yellow,
thus distinguishing it from hematite.
Disseminated through beds of
clay, limonite gives them the characteristic
yellow color. Such clays turn
red when heated, since the water of
the limonite is driven off, leaving
hematite as a residue. This is the explanation
of the usual coloring of
bricks. Yellow ochre is impure, or
earthy, limonite.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ANYONE who has traveled extensively
has had an opportunity
in some of the ocean voyages
to witness the seasickness of
animals, and many queer stories are
told from time to time of their actions
at such times&mdash;how lions become un-kinglike,
monkeys ape humanity, and
dogs are especially woeful&mdash;and one
realizes that human beings are not the
only ones that suffer from seasickness,
by any means.</p>

<p>One hears a good deal about pangs
that have filled the men and women
with woe, but little is said of the menageries
brought to America every year,
or carried hither and yon in wave-tossed
boats.</p>

<p>Lions and tigers may be majestic
when they have unwavering earth or
rock against their paws, but a seasick
cat of these tribes is as forlorn as any
man ever was, and doesn't look a bit
more kingly than a wet rabbit. Even
its roars and growls have a weeping
sound in them, quite in keeping with
the general appearance of the beast.</p>

<p>A monkey is as pitiable an object
when it is seasick as any other beast so
stricken, and its forlorn facial expression
is so humanlike and the way it
clasps its paws across its stomach is so
natural that the man who is not seasick
necessarily sees something to laugh at
in the misery of the creature. Not so
with the seasick man. If he sees a
seasick monkey he is sure to get very
angry, thinking the poor thing is mocking
him.</p>

<p>It takes a dog to be woeful at sea.
It has a way of doubling all up, with
its tail between its legs and its head
hanging down that shows a deep-seated
pain. To free itself the dog goes
through all sorts of contortions. It
will stretch out on the deck, groan and
whine, sometimes rising on its haunches
and lifting its head and howling long
and miserably, as some dogs do at the
sound of music.</p>

<p>Many other animals show signs of
great distress when on the water in
rough weather, and any animal that is
thoroughly seasick will show almost
human signs of distress and appeal for
sympathy, yet one can scarcely help
laughing at their actions, even in the
face of their evident suffering.</p>
